# Full-stack CRUD application project
## Introduction
Yountville Veterans Homes' Plant Services team needed a database to help them monitor their performance in providing services to the facilities in the Yountville Veterans Homes. I developed a CRUD web app that will allow the staff to read and update their database (built using the SQLite3 database management system) using an HTML-based user interface. The code I used involved Python modules.
## Method
I  based this project's code on Alicia Gilbert's documentation of her CRUD application; hers used MySQL as its database management system. I, on the other hand, used SQLite3. I opted for SQLite3 because it is pretty portable compared to MySQL (which requires users to install the MySQL database engine on their own computers or access the MySQL database on my server).

For the user interface, I'm following the clean aesthetic done by Mbithe Nzomo on her CRUD web app.
